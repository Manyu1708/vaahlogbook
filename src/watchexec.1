.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Recursively monitors the current directory for changes, executing the command when a filesystem change is detected\. By default, watchexec uses efficient kernel\-level mechanisms to watch for changes\.
.
.P
At startup, the specified \fIcommand\fR (passing any supplied \fIargument\fRs) is run once, and watchexec begins monitoring for changes\.
.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.
.TP
\fIcommand\fR
Command to run when watched files are modified, and at startup, unless \fB\-\-postpone\fR is specified\. All \fIargument\fRs are passed to \fIcommand\fR\. If you pass flags to the command, you should separate it with \fB\-\-\fR, for example: \fBwatchexec \-w src \-\- rsync \-a src dest\fR\.
.
.P
Behaviour depends on the value of \fB\-\-shell\fR: for all except \fBnone\fR, every part of \fIcommand\fR is joined together into one string with a single ascii space character, and given to the shell as described\. For \fBnone\fR, each distinct element of \fIcommand\fR is passed as per the execvp(3) convention: first argument is the program, as a file or searched in the \fBPATH\fR, rest are arguments\.
.
.TP
\fB\-e\fR, \fB\-\-exts\fR \fIextensions\fR
Comma\-separated list of file extensions to filter by\. Leading dots (\.rs) are allowed\. (This is a shorthand for \fB\-f\fR)\.
.
.TP
\fB\-f\fR, \fB\-\-filter\fR \fIpattern\fR
Ignores modifications from paths that do not match \fIpattern\fR\. This option can be specified multiple times, where a match on any given pattern causes the path to trigger \fIcommand\fR\.
.
.TP
\fB\-s\fR, \fB\-\-signal\fR
Sends the specified signal (e\.g\. \fBSIGKILL\fR) to the command\. Defaults to \fBSIGTERM\fR\.
.
.TP
\fB\-\-shell\fR \fIshell\fR
Change the shell used to run the command\. Set to \fBnone\fR to run the command directly without a shell\.
.
.P
The special value \fBpowershell\fR will use Microsoft Powershell\'s calling convention, otherwise \fBSHELL \-c COMMAND\fR\.
.
.P
On Windows, the additional \fBcmd\fR special value uses CMD\.EXE calling convention\.
.
.P
The \fBnone\fR value is especially useful in combination with \fB\-\-signal\fR, as the signal is then sent directly to the running command\. While \fB\-\-shell=none\fR is a little more performant than the default, it prevents using shell\-features like pipes and redirects\.
.
.P
If not a special value, the string provided may contain arguments to the shell as long as that is kept simple: the string is split along whitespace, and used as per execvp(3): first is shell program, rest are arguments to the shell, then \fB\-c\fR is added, and finally the \fBCOMMAND\fR\.
.
.P
See the \fIEXAMPLES\fR for uses of each of these\.
.
.TP
\fB\-\-no\-shell\fR
Deprecated\. Alias for \fB\-\-shell=none\fR\.
.
.TP
\fB\-n\fR
Shorthand for \fB\-\-shell=none\fR\.
.
.TP
\fB\-\-no\-meta\fR
Ignore metadata changes\.
.
.TP
\fB\-\-no\-environment\fR
Do not set WATCHEXEC\fI*\fRPATH environment variables for the command\.
.
.TP
\fB\-i\fR, \fB\-\-ignore\fR \fIpattern\fR
Ignores modifications from paths that match \fIpattern\fR\. This option can be specified multiple times, and a match on any pattern causes the path to be ignored\.
.
.TP
\fB\-w\fR, \fB\-\-watch\fR \fIpath\fR
Monitor a specific path for changes\. By default, the current working directory is watched\. This may be specified multiple times, where a change in any watched directory (and subdirectories) causes \fIcommand\fR to be executed\.
.
.TP
\fB\-r\fR, \fB\-\-restart\fR
Terminates the command if it is still running when subsequent file modifications are detected\. By default, sends \fBSIGTERM\fR; use \fB\-\-signal\fR to change that\.
.
.TP
\fB\-W\fR, \fB\-\-watch\-when\-idle\fR
Ignore events while the process is still running\. This is distinct from \fB\-\-restart\fR in that with this option, events received while the command is running will not trigger a new run immediately after the current command is done\.
.
.P
This behaviour will become the default in v2\.0\.
.
.TP
\fB\-\-no\-process\-group\fR
Do not use a process group when running \fIcommand\fR\.
.
.TP
\fB\-c\fR, \fB\-\-clear\fR
Clears the screen before executing \fIcommand\fR\.
.
.TP
\fB\-p\fR, \fB\-\-postpone\fR
Postpone execution of \fIcommand\fR until the first file modification is detected\.
.
.TP
\fB\-\-force\-poll\fR \fIinterval\fR
Poll for changes every \fIinterval\fR ms instead of using system\-specific notification mechanisms (such as inotify)\. This is useful when you are monitoring NFS shares\.
.
.TP
\fB\-d\fR, \fB\-\-debounce\fR
Set the timeout between detected change and command execution, to avoid restarting too frequently when there are many events; defaults to 100ms\.
.
.TP
\fB\-\-no\-vcs\-ignore\fR
Skip loading of version control system (VCS) ignore files\. By default, watchexec loads \.gitignore files in the current directory (or parent directories) and uses them to populate the ignore list\.
.
.TP
\fB\-\-no\-default\-ignore\fR
Skip default ignore statements\. By default, watchexec ignores common temporary files for you, for example \fB*\.swp\fR, \fB*\.pyc\fR, and \fB\.DS_Store\fR\.
.
.TP
\fB\-v\fR, \fB\-\-verbose\fR
Prints diagnostic messages to STDERR\.
.
.TP
\fB\-\-changes\-only\fR
Prints the paths that have changed as diagnostics to STDERR, but not everything else that \fB\-\-verbose\fR prints\.
.
.TP
\fB\-V\fR, \fB\-\-version\fR
Print the version of watchexec\.
.
.TP
\fB\-h\fR, \fB\-\-help\fR
Print a help message\.
.
.SH "ENVIRONMENT"
Processes started by watchexec have environment variables set describing the modification(s) observed\. Which variable is set depends on how many modifications were observed and/or what type they were\.
.

.
.IP "\(bu" 4
